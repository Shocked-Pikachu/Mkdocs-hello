## About Me

<div align=left> <img src="assets/Pikachu.jpg" width=150> </div>

I am currently a junior (third-year) undergraduate student at the School of Physics, Peking University, and I will be starting as a PhD candidate in the same school in the Fall of 2025.

## Why I built this page?

I have been hoping to have my own homepage where I could share the courses I have learned and my own learning experiences for a long time. However, setting up a page takes a tremendous amount of time, particular in learning and continuous maintenance. It is often struggling to learn technologies you've never been exposed to before, but luckily I was able to learn a lot from friends around me. Thanks to [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), I was able to build my own beautiful and simple homepage in a short time. I also appreciate my friends around me for your support and help which keep me moving forward.
